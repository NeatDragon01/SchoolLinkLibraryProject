SCHOOL LINK LIBRARY PROJECT

DESCRIPTION:
This is a basic HTML project with some light CSS integration. It is nothing fancy, but it is a working project I am using for my own webdev journey.
If you stumbled on this repository, it is nothing crazy, but it might be useful. This HTML file contains links to verified safe and school-friendly learning environments on the internet.
These links are confirmed working as of 2023-10-24.

Thank you for your time.
